# Project 4
 Project for the Lede Program - Selfie Deaths

Describe briefly what this README.md is about and provide major information about the relevant story; hyperlink to everything you refer to. Let's say, this is to walk readers through the data used and the analysis conducted for a story entitled "Working title of the story", published on June XX, 2021. The story is my second individual project as part of the Lede 2021 program.

## Data
Here is what relates to your data, including sources, collection, cleaning and processing.

<b> Sources </b>
- <b> Source 1 </b>: What is your Source 1, what data they provide, what we need to know about data coverage (i.e. time span), what is the format of the provided data, what is the license of use provided (if it is about open data), etc
- <b> Source 2 </b>: Same as above


<b> Collection </b>
<p> This is to describe how you collected your data. Did they provided the data to you upon request? Did you scrape the web? And, if yes, what are the libraries you used to do that? In case you are based on open and publicly available datasets that you downloaded, you can skip that given that you provide relevant information in Sources section. </p>


<b> Processing </b>
<p> This is to describe any processing of the raw data, including compiling datasets, data cleaning and data corrections, how you treated missing data (i.e. Did you drop null values? Did you impute null values and how did you do that?), etc. 
    
    
<b> About your final dataset </b>
<p> If you compiled datasets, you modified your raw data, you restructured and/or you (re)created a dataset, you can describe your final dataset from which your analysis derives. If you are allowed to make this dataset publicly available and you have done so, please a provide a hyperlink to that and make a list of your column names/variables, explaining what they are about if it is needed.</p>

## Analysis

Here is where you provide detailed information about the data analysis you conducted. This could be a long list of explanatory notes on:

- things you calculated and how you did that
- decisions you made while conducting the analysis: i.e. why decide to analyze something instead of something else, information on numbers' normalization, why you decided to calculate a 7-day moving average to show evolution through time, how you calculated the average value of a variable, by mean or by median, etc)
- tools you used to analyze your data

## Visualizations

Here is where you provide information about the graphics you produced, including any notes on things one should pay attention to, decisions you made though the process (i.e. Did you choose to produce a choropleth instead of a point map? Why?) and tools you used to create your visualizations. 

## Limitations
This is to describe any kind of limitations or problems you faced. You could refer either to resolved ones (i.e. how you handled specific limitations and what is the solution you're offering) or to things you didn't manage to overcome as part of this project and they are still open research questions.

## Contact
Here is where your contact details go in case people have questions or comments and they wish to reach out to you.
