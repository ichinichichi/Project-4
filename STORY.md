### LEAD

In 2016 a lot of news regarding selfie-deaths were reported and the Indian Ministry of Tourism even tried to identify ["selfie danger" areas](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/now-no-selfies-allowed-in-front-of-national-memorials-from-august-12-18/story-8BrHFgmxKpnvOUzdsT6U1N.html) since most death came from there. Did identifying those zones work to reduce the numbers? Even just yesterday, the 8th of July 2021, it was reported from the [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9767113/Kangaroo-Point-tragedy-Brazilian-woman-died-falling-cliff-taking-selfie.html) that a Brazilian woman died after falling off the cliff when she took a selfie. Did the trend with taking selfies from high places for views and likes not go away and do most selfie-takers die by falling?

Can we identify selfie-danger hotspots worldwide?

There is a clear decrease from the incidents as well as the casualty count from 2017 to 2018. It is no surprise that 2016 had a lot of news reporting about selfie-deaths since a lot of them were happening this year. 

Did the barricading of those danger zones after accidents happen help to decrease the numbers. There can be more research done but it surly is contributing to it.

2020 shows low numbers probably because of Covid. A further anaylsis showed that a lot of accidents happen in the summer months and thr travel restrictions could have contributed to the lower numbers.

Even though 2021 is not over yet the numbers are already higher than 2021 and of casualty/injuries seem much higher than the accident count. This is because in May 2021 the [most fatal selfie incident](https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2021/05/16/at-least-seven-dead-in-central-java-boat-selfie-accident-.html) happened in Indonesia. 9 people drowned, when all 20 passengers of on overloaded boat flipped it when they took a selfie on the right side of the vessel.

However, the biggest incident involving 48 injured people happend when a close bakery was engulfed in flames and the onlookers were dsitracted with taking selfies. [India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/chennai-bakery-fire-onlookers-injured-selfie-craze-1024652-2017-07-17):

So there are different types people got injured, but what are the most common ones?

A short word analysis I did showed the most often mentioned words in all those accidents and the word "trains" were quite high up and were involved in most of the transport type selfie-deaths.

It also showed that most selfie-takers were 20-22 years of age. [A 2018 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6131996) showed that the mean age was 23 years old and usually male.

Since 2019 India has no incidents anymore and looking at the last 3 year the US is leading the chart now. The danger zones seemes to have helped.
