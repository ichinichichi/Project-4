# Working title of your story

### LEAD
Please provide a summary that leads your story. Your lead aims to set the tone and introduce the reader to the rest of the story. A good lead sums up your story in a few words.

## TEXT 
Here is where you unfold your story. 

## GRAPHIC 
Please import your graphics as images and link to them if they are interactive and initially created somewhere else (i.e. with the use of Datawrapper). 
Here is how you can import images: 
1. Click on a cell in your Jupyter Notebook
2. On the toolbar, where "Code" is currently displayed, choose "Markdown" form the dropdown list.
3. Click on the Edit menu, click on "Insert image"
4. Import your image and run the cell. Your image should be displayed; here is an example.

(You keep going on with words and graphics in the same way as described above.)


```python

#### METHODOLOGY
When you are done with your story, please provide a footnote on where one can find your documentation.
